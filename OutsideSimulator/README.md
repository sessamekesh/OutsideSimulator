# Outside Simulator

Must download SlimDX runtime (http://slimdx.org/download.php) to run this project.

Uses Direct3D11 for all rendering.

I'll fill in this file more later. This is a homework assignment for CS 5700 at USU, when I'm done I'll actually work on making something pretty cool. Eventually I'd like to demonstrate kind of how to create a 3D game!
